This is the 2nd in a series of little synths that I'll be publishing over the next couple builds. Like my Elements synth, I've kept everything as simple as possible on this build so anyone with a soldering iron and basic soldering skills can make it. I've done away with a case and fancy power supplies to keep the build simple.

Props to Synther Jack (https://syntherjack.net/totoro-1-ic-simple-synth/) who designed this amazing little synth. All I've done is redesigned the PCB and created a front panel. I've also done a couple of mods and have included these on this build. Please check out Synther Jacks write up if you want a thorough run through on how the synth works.

The synth runs off 1 IC which is an incredible feat when you consider the amazing sounds this beast can produce. The other amazing thing about this synth is it only needs 2 X AA batteries to power it!

It's a blast to play with and can be connected to a sequencer which really shows off the sounds this little synth is capable of producing. If you don't have a sequencer then don't worry - it's still tonnes of fun to play.
